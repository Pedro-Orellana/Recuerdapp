# Recuerdapp
Android app to write and manage notes, and get remembered of things to do throughout your day

The idea is to have a note-taking app that can send you notifications based on specific criteria you write. Say, for example, you write a note to remind yourself that when you get home, you will pull the chicken out of the freezer, but it has to be right at 4 pm, just so that is ready time. Based on that, Recuerdapp will send you a notification when the following criteria is met: you are at home, and it is 4 pm.
